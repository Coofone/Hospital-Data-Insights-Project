# Hospital-Data-Insights-Project
The "Hospital Data Insights" dashboard presents real patient data from five hospitals in Myanmar, revealing key trends, patterns, and insights. It serves healthcare professionals, administrators, and policymakers with valuable information for informed decision-making.

## Problem Statements and Why it is Important in Our Daily Lives
Our families, friends, and colleagues bring us joy and connection. When we lose one of them, the pain is profound, and we instinctively want to understand why it happened. What was the cause of death? Could it have been prevented? This search for answers isn't just personal—it impacts entire communities and countries.

A robust medical record system offers the data and insights needed to address these questions at a national level. For Myanmar, understanding which age groups in specific regions suffer from certain diseases is crucial for shaping effective healthcare policies. Imagine knowing the top 10 diseases that afflict your country. This knowledge allows policymakers to direct resources where they're needed most, devise targeted health campaigns, and reduce mortality rates.

Consider the impact of this information: if you know that a particular region has a high rate of heart disease, public health officials can launch awareness programs about heart health, promote exercise, and provide better access to cardiology services. If data shows that young children are most at risk for certain infections, vaccination programs can be intensified in those areas.

A well-designed medical record system doesn't just capture individual stories of loss and illness—it transforms those stories into actionable insights. By analyzing these insights, Myanmar can create policies that protect the people who mean the most to us: our families, friends, and colleagues. Ultimately, it's not just about reducing the number of deaths—it's about enhancing the quality of life for everyone in our community.

## Empowering Medical Records Technicians: My Experience in ICT Training

In 2018, my work involved providing ICT-related training to medical records technicians across Myanmar. During this time, our team successfully trained over 870 technicians, spreading knowledge and skills to support the nation's healthcare infrastructure. It was a rewarding experience because I have a passion for data and believe in its power to transform industries like healthcare. 

I also love sharing my knowledge with others and supporting training operations. Seeing the impact of my work—helping medical records technicians gain new skills and apply them in their roles—was immensely satisfying. It wasn't just about teaching technology; it was about empowering these professionals to manage and analyze critical medical data effectively, contributing to better healthcare outcomes.

While working on this project, we visited six hospitals, analyzed data using R, and visualized the results on QGIS. This entire process and procedure were then shared with senior medical records technicians. I kept a detailed record of this project in my portfolio.

It's important to note that although the data is based on real patient information, I anonymized and modified sensitive details like patient names and addresses to maintain confidentiality. The total dataset contained over 560,000 patient records, making it a substantial source for analysis and visualization.
